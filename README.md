# MIXED MESSAGES: Random message generator.
## In this project, I decided to create 3 arrays of data, 'Inspirational Quotes','Word of the day', and 'Fun Fact'. Everytime you run the program, it will display a random element from each array. There will not be any repitition until all the elements have been shown once. History will show all previous elements and will be cleared once all elements have been displayed once.
### The link below will lead to the html website that I have created to demonstrate the functionality of the code. To run the program, click the title 'MIXED MESSAGES'.
